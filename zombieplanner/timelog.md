| 11/4/2024  | 2:00 pm    |   MTG    | I attended class to plan my next personal project for this sprint and to discuss my team's goals for the next two weeks as well.                                                                                                                                                                         |      60       |
| 11/5/2024  | 5:00 pm    |    IM    | I researched some IDE's that could be useful when trying to create a project in Typescript.

| 11/6/2024  | 12:30 pm   |    IM    | I started to follow the lessons on CodeAcademy for Typescript and also reviewed the languages official syntax sheets and some tutorials online.                                                                                                                                                          |      90       |

| 11/7/2024  | 3:00 pm    |    IM    | I continued to follow the CodeAcademy lessons for Typescript and tried to fully plan out my idea for the project and the different files and classes that I'd have to make.                                                                                                                              |      60       |

| 11/11/2024 | 2:00 pm    |    TP    | I attended class and got help for my dragbutton code from my teammate, between both of us we were able to get it fully functional and then pushed to github for our presentation next class.                                                                                                             |      60       |
| 11/12/2024 | 4:00 pm    |    IM    | I started to write the survivor and constants classes which are used a lot throughout the program, I also brainstormed some future ideas to make the project even more fun.                                                                                                                              |      60       |

| 11/14/2024 | 3:00 pm    |    IM    | I worked on finishing my other classes today, tried my best to get them to all function together and to function within the index for the main game loop.                                                                                                                                                |      90       |
| 11/15/2024 | 6:00 pm    |    IM    | When clearing the index file of any errors and running it fully for the first time I realized that there is an error that I don't know how to work around, in the future I would love to fix this either for my own sense of satisfaction or for a resubmittal but right now I don't know how to fix it. |      90       |
